**Challenge #1.1**: To practice the basics of HTML, create a simple web page with at least 10 distinct HTML elements. 
**Goal #1.1**: An HTML file named `index.html`.

**Challenge #1.2**: In addition to HTML, let's add some styles: create a stylesheet with 10 different CSS properties for your web page.
**Goal #1.2**: A CSS stylesheet named `styles.css`.

**Challenge #1.3**: It's always a good idea to use version control with your projects, no matter how simple. Create a git repository, add your HTML & CSS to it, and upload it to Github. 
**Goal #1.3**: Submit your Github URL below.

### Adventure Mode

**Challenge #2.1**: Now that you've created your own webpage, give debugging a try! Take a look at [this Github repo](https://github.com/tiy-lv-frontend-2016-02/tiy-html-day-1-debug) containing a broken project. Fork the project, clone it to your computer, and fix the HTML & CSS so that the webpage renders appropriately. Don't forget to push your changes up to your fork of the project!
**Goal #2.1**: Submit your fork's Github URL below.
